I’m working on an operating system with the goal of being simple and elegant, while taking ideas from Smalltalk and the original Macintosh.
I’m learning C and Python and have a reasonable understanding of both.
My Discord is spotracite#9842 and I can sometimes be found at #fvwm and #osdev on Freenode as spotracite.
Feel free to ask about anything!
