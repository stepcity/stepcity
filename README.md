### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bruno, a student who likes to look at code and occasionally writes his own.

Iâ€™m working on Peak, an operating system with the goal of being simple and elegant.
Iâ€™m learning C and Python and have a reasonable understanding of both.
My Discord is superiorUser#6383 and I can sometimes be found at #fvwm and #osdev on Freenode as spotracite.
Feel free to ask about anything!
