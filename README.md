I’m working on an operating system with the goal of being simple and elegant, while taking ideas from Smalltalk, the original Macintosh, and the LISP Machines.
I’m reasonably well versed in C and Smalltalk and ~~Python~~ not Python, I hate that crummy language.
My Discord is ramyel#9208 and I can sometimes be found at #fvwm and #osdev on Freenode as spotracite.
Feel free to ask about anything!
